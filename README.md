# Project-Polygon-Source-Code
The source code is really good and pizza did a great job on it. Pizzaboxer dropped the source on polygon discord (not by mistake) so that why this repo is here. The source is not the newest, it is from october 2020 and has no SQL cause pizza let figuring out the SQL structure as a challenge. So i will be accepting his challenge and i will figure out the SQL structure and upload it in the vapor edition of this source code on this repo when i am done.
